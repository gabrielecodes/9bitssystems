## Why Having a Data Strategy

<br/>

Technical debt is quite widespread in our fast-paced world. Technology changes quickly and many companies struggle to catch up.
Many companies have competences in developing their product or service and that's where thei pour most of their resources. In this environment technology tends to become an aftertought and fixing things later can be painful. We've worked on the front lines with these companies for years, either as employees or consultants, and the one universal truth we've discovered is this: no matter the size, a company that fails to implement a serious data strategy is fighting an uphill battle in the modern world.

<br/>

Whether itâ€™s a small startup or a big fintech, the symptoms of a missing data strategy are remarkably consistent. For many of our clients, the primary struggle is a **lack of agility**. When the leadership team needs to understand the performance of the company, from the large summary figures, to the details of the product, they're left waiting weeks for a report that's pieced together from half a dozen different systems, each with its own data format and a _different version of the truth_. By the time they get the answers, the opportunity has often passed.

<br/>

Another major struggle is **inefficiency**. Many teams, from marketing to supply chain, wasting countless hours on manual data cleanup and reconciliation. They're basically acting as human data pipelines, trying to stitch together information that should be flowing seamlessly. This isn't just a waste of money, it makes daily work a struggle.

<br/>

Finally, and perhaps most critically, is the struggle with **compliance and security**. In today's regulatory environment, with standards like GDPR and CCPA, a solid _data strategy_ cannot be an afterthought. Companies that lack data governance are at risk.
