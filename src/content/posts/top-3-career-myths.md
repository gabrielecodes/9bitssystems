“You don’t need programming skills.”
Myth: Some people believe data engineering is mostly configuration or using no-code tools — so you can succeed without knowing how to code.
Reality: Programming is core — whether it’s writing ETL/ELT pipelines, transforming data, dealing with schemas, handling errors, or automating tasks. Even tools that seem “no-code” often hide complexity or require scripting to customize. Employers expect comfort with languages like Python, SQL, or Scala.

“Data engineering is just moving data around / just ETL.”
Myth: The role is often reduced to “extract-transform-load” and data engineers are thought of as mere shuttles of data from point A to point B.
Reality: Modern data engineering involves much more: designing scalable data architectures, ensuring data quality and governance, handling streaming data, optimizing performance, ensuring observability/monitoring, handling schema evolution, and supporting downstream analytics or ML. 

“You must have a computer science degree (or advanced degree).”
Myth: Only people with formal CS or high-level degrees (Masters/PhD) can be successful as data engineers.
Reality: While a CS or related background can help, many data engineers come from varied fields. What matters more is practical experience, understanding of data modeling, cloud platforms, pipeline building, handling failures, and continuous learning. Hands-on projects, understanding toolchains, and problem solving often matter more than pedigree.
