## Introduction

A post on LinkedIn caught my attention. The author was mentioning that <em>engineering and data teams</em> need to be on board with embracing AI, otherwise the company will move rapidly in one domain and remain behind in another.

I understand the appeal of AI, it can really increase your productivity if used correctly and it's fun. I'd argue though that the premises of the thesis above are not entirely agreable.

First, **engineering is not like marketing or sales**. There's no reason why "progress" in different teams can and should necessarily be measured in the same way. Theese teams have very different functions and goals, and operate on a daily basis in different ways.

Second, **AI is biased** in the sense that it's particularily good at writing text (and producing images thou we're not interested in that in this article). Even with considering that AI is capable, in some sense and with varying degree, to "understand" text, it doesn't mean that it's production has the same value for every task. be it writing copy for advertising or writing code. Clearly these use cases, both solved by the production of "text", imply very different skills. The magical coding abilities of AI have been sponsored for a while, but as of the date of this article, clearly we don't have an AI capable of replacing even the average programmer, without mentioning the nightmare of security and the costly accidents that already happened.

I engaged with a question. My question was:

<blockquote>
<strong>"</strong>What are the best uses of AI in data engineering?<strong>"</strong>
</blockquote>

And I received a reply. Here it is verbatim:

<blockquote>
<strong>"</strong>Gabriele C. Debugging and more general boilerplate generation! Also great for tracking down things like consistent data definitions or metric calculations.<strong>"</strong>
</blockquote>
