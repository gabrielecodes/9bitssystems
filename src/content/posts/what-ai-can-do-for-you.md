## What has AI done for you lately?

I recently stumbled upon a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luw5AlD6is8) confirming that the AI hype narrative is finally showing some cracks. A pervasive trend over the last couple of years proposes that individuals can earn **significant money (even $100k/month)** by selling AI automation built entirely with no-code connectors like n8n. These are automation softwares with a graphical interface where you can drag-and-drop a series of "building blocks" to create a sequence of operations, e.g. reading an email, generating a text response and sending
a reply plus a phone notification. This setup theoretically solves the problem of replying to emails one by one. It sounds easy and effective, but the real question is: _does a simple automation truly move the needle enough to command large consulting fees?_

Here's the truth: most of the revenue of these content creators does not come from selling
AI automation, but from selling courses, educational material or from social media ads. Some have come forward
saying this explicitly.

## No free lunch?

There is a saying, _"the people making money during the gold rush are those that are selling shovels"_. As in any engineering
endeavor, the more you dig into a problem, the more questions come out and details become progressively more intricated
and layered. As you build your system you must take into account service level objectives while maintaining scalability and
that is complex in and of itself.

First of all, as I touched upon in [another article](https://ninebitssystems.com/blog/ai-in-data-engineering.md), different use cases benefit from AI in varied ways. Outside of simple automation, AI has critical problems when used at scale. This complexity involves costs, security implications, data protection regulations, and, critically, the inherent variability of AI output. A single negative experience, such as a poorly written email, is enough to severely reduce confidence in the entire automation system.

Second, let's look at the reality of consulting in general. **Attracting new clients and lead generation are
time consuming and somewhat expensive operations**. After that, there is the barrier of **earning trust of new clients**.

Most businesses are small or medium sized and don't have a solid data culture with the perfectly curated datasets
that are typically seen in online educational content. Even large companies, struggle to curate large datasets and to make that
data available to all the parts of the business. In these settings

## What are the applications of AI that really have impact?

Structured data is relatively easy to store and manipulate, but achieving the same results efficiently with unstructured data at scale presents a major challenge. AI excels at generating and manipulating unstructured data—specifically large volumes of text, images, and audio—tasks that are highly inefficient for humans to scale. This is nothing new, _that's what we all knew back in the days of Machine Learning and Neural Networks_, and things haven't changed that much with LLMs.

### Producing and "understanding" text at scale

AI can read, summarize, generate, and categorize vast amounts of text almost instantaneously.

Example (Internal): An AI system can triage every incoming support email or document, identifying priority level, topic, and necessary action, then drafting a personalized (but supervised) first-response, saving human agents hours of manual sorting. I underline that for sensitive or client-facing applications, human supervision is advised.

Example (Marketing): A single core piece of content (like a webinar transcript) can be fed to the AI, which can automatically repurpose and generate many unique social media captions, a dozen newsletter blurbs, and a complete SEO summary.

### Creating and Manipulating Images

AI can generate, edit, and modify visual content much faster and cheaper than a graphic designer, making rapid iteration possible.

Example: A marketing team can quickly iterate on hundreds of ad creatives by instructing the AI to generate product images with varied backgrounds, different lighting, and specific text overlays for A/B testing, dramatically speeding up campaign deployment.

### Audio Generation

AI can produce high-quality, synthetic human speech, allowing for instant voice-overs without needing a recording studio.

Example: Educational videos, short-form content, voice-over for training and instruction videos.

## Conclusion

True AI success today requires getting granular: focusing on a business's **specific bottlenecks** and implementing creative, custom solutions. Although a project may not immediately add revenue, it can dramatically **lower operational costs** by automating internal tasks that are difficult for humans to scale (like large-volume text or image generation).

In the current technological landscape, a high-impact AI solution **cannot be sold as a one-click template**. It requires true consultancy, careful implementation, and human oversight. That said, feasibility is not the problem; **sustainability and genuine value** are achieved by moving past the hype and focusing on these deep, specific efficiency improvements.
